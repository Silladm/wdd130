                Of all the things I thought I would ever do, <em>coding</em> was not one of them. I grew up in an artistic family. We spent hours drawing paperdolls and recording radio shows on our cassette tapes. To date, my favorite activities are <strong>creative</strong> ones like 
                <ul>
                    <li>writing</li>
                    <li>singing</li>
                    <li>drawing/painting</li>
                    <li>redecorating my home</li>
    
                </ul>
            </p1>
            <p2>
                 What I have learned this week; however, is that coding can be very creative too! Coding builds problem-solving skills, expands the imagine, and develops better thinking skills. I am still creating; it is just that the medium has changed.
