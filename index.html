    <h1>Diane Silla Has Arrived</h1>
    <p>Of all the things I thought I would ever do, <em>coding</em> was not one of them. I grew up in an artistic family. We spent hours drawing paperdolls and recording radio shows on our cassette tapes. To date, my favorite activities are <strong>creative</strong> ones like</p>
        <ul>
            <li>writing</li>
            <li>singing</li>
            <li>drawing/painting</li>
            <li>redecorating my home</li>
        </ul>

    <p>What I have learned this week; however, is that coding can be very creative too! Coding builds problem-solving skills, expands the imagine, and develops better thinking skills. I am still creating; it is just that the medium has changed.</p>
