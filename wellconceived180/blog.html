                <p>In the years leading up to the launch of Well-Conceived 180, I struggled to find the term that described my target community. Infertility and childlessness was only a slice of the population. ALI (adoption, loss, and infertility) was closer, but it didnâ€™t explicitly include foster-parents or singles or LGBTQI+ individuals, which were valuable members of my supportive community...</p>

                <p>Christene was 47 years old when I met her in the waiting room at the ob-gyn. Forty-seven! And pregnant?! I went through my last IVF three years ago, at age 42. It was starkly different from the first time, ten years before, and always in my mind were those tables of THE ODDS...</p>

                <p>Even though three years have come and gone since my last ART procedure, my interest still piques when I see infertility breakthroughs or milestones. This morning a developing new procedure called In Vitro Maturation (IVM) showed up in my newsfeed. I wish I'd known about when JD and I started out on our infertility journey....</p>

                <p>Suleman may be an extreme case, but the question nags at us all, especially those of us who try and fail to grow our families. When is it time to move to the next option? When is it time to hang up the towel? When should we hold on? When should we let go?
