                <p>The decision to start a family is possibly the most consequential choice we can make in life. But what happens when you want a baby, you’ve prepared and anticipated and maybe even NAMED that baby, but all attempts are in vain? </p>
                <p>Navigating this trail called infertility can be the journey of a lifetime. It can be the source of both despair and euphoria, of both inadequacy and gratitude, of isolation and camaraderie. In many ways I’m at the end of this journey—I’ve given away my stash of pregnancy clothes and the brand new Christening dress I hung in the closet for fifteen hopeful years. I’m letting my foster care license expire this year and turning our spare bedroom into a space for my creative projects to come into being. For the first time in my life I see my family as complete and myself as a whole person, infertility and all. </p>
                <p>It's time to come to term with it.</p>
                <p>What is a well-conceived 180? First and foremost, it is a meeting place for those of us in the ALI (adoption, loss, and infertility) community. It is also a place of  creative recovery, where brain-children are birthed and grow.
                <p>Sometimes it’s difficult to thrive on the ALI path, but I know it’s not impossible.</p>
