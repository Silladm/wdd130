            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>The decision to start a family is possibly the most consequential choice we can make in life. But what happens when you want a baby, youâ€™ve prepared and anticipated and maybe even NAMED that baby, but all attempts are in vain? Navigating this trail called infertility can be a source of despair and euphoria, inadequacy and gratitude, isolation and camaraderie. The Well-Conceived 180 is a place where creativity meets pro-creativity, where we conquer ALI (adoption, loss, infertility) challenge.

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>The target audience is anyone who has struggled (past or present) with issues associated with adoption, loss, and/or infertility. There is a strong emphasis on narrative life-coaching, which is a technique for reframing the perceived negative life events in a way that is empowering and supportive.
